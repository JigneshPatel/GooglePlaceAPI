To use the GooglePlaceAPI just copy the content files of 3 folder:
-JSON
-ASIHTTPRequest
-GooglePlaceAPI

Next you have to link the following frameworks to the xcode project
-CoreLocation
-MapKit
-MobileCoreServices
-SystemConfiguration
-CFNetwork
-libz.dylib

Then just import GooglePlaceAPI.h to use the API

If you want to add more feature just fork and send me a pull request

As a bonus I have added an auto complete search bar with google place autocomplete
